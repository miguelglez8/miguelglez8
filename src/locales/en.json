    "aboutMe": "About Me",
    "description": "Software Engineer with 1.5 years of professional experience in Java and Liferay, specialized in developing custom web portals and backend services. I have hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and optimizing portlets, REST APIs, and microservices, working with technologies such as Java, JSP, React, HTML/CSS, Docker, and relational and non-relational databases. I have also worked with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, designing and deploying scalable and efficient solutions tailored to project needs. During my internships, I gained additional experience with Spring (Spring Boot), developing backend services and distributed APIs. Currently, I focus on backend web development and Liferay portals, integrating services and optimizing user experience. I’m passionate about designing efficient and scalable systems, applying best practices, automation, and software quality principles, and participating in projects that involve complex technical challenges.",
