    "description": "I am a Software Engineering graduate with extensive experience in application development using technologies such as JavaScript, React, Docker, Spring, Java, JSP, and HTML. I have a strong background in mathematics, programming, and system design, having worked on projects ranging from web solutions to distributed applications and microservices. I have experience with both relational and non-relational databases, as well as cloud platforms such as AWS and Firebase, where I have designed and deployed scalable and efficient solutions. Currently, I focus on web development, particularly backend development, and I am involved in the creation of custom portals, service integration, and optimizing user experience in Liferay. I am interested in designing and developing efficient and scalable systems, which leads me to explore the field of digital architecture. Passionate about technological innovation and motivated by solving complex problems, I actively participate in personal and collaborative projects that aim to drive technological progress.",
